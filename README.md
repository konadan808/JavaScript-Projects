Repository created for submission of any coursework from the JavaScript course with the Tech Academy
Introduction:

	projects, I have utilized many concepts that were both instructed to me as well as directed to figure out.

Tech:
	- Languages used: HTML5, CSS(CSS3) JavaScript
	- IDE: Visual Studio Code
	- Chrome Web Browser

Projects:
	- Pizza Menu: Utilized JavaScript functionality to enable price calculation based upon chosen pizza size and toppings.
	- Tic-Tac-Toe Game: Created a grid based gameboard and used JavaScript to determin who's turn it was, what pieces were placed on a claimed square, add a computer controlled opponent that selected 
		squares at random, and determined win and tie conditions.  Added my own graphics and sound effects.
	- Calculator:  Created a basic calculator that was styled using CSS and given functionality with JavaScript.
